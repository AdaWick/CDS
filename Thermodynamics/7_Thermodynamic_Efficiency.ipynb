    "This module, consisting of 4 lessons, introduces the idea of *quality* to our discussion of energy we developed in the previous module.  We first think of energy as a quantity: how many joules of energy does it take to move a car a certain distance or to heat up a certain amount of food, for example.  It turns out that this is not a complete picture.  The air in your room contains a large amount of energy in the form of the kinetic and vibrational energy of the molecules making up the air.  However, it is not really practical to try to harness this energy to do something productive.  Another comparison is a small amount of flowing water vs. a large amount of still water.  They may store the same amount of total kinetic energy, but the first case is more useful for hydroelectric energy conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we introduce the idea of *efficiency*, which we use as a comparitive: how well does our proposed design match up with the theoretical \"best\" design for a given scenario.  To do this, we will have to determine a way to calculate the \"best\" design, even if it can't actually be built.  This still has practical value though; it gives you a \"gold standard\" to compare any practical design against, and hence a means of comparing any two practical designs against each other."

    "Let's start with the question posed above: How much energy does it take to heat a house?  If a house were perfectly insulated, no heat would escape, and so theoretically it wouldn't take any energy to maintain a constant indoor temperature.  Of course, a house isn't perfectly insulated, and so some heat escapes based on the materials and thicknesses of the walls and the temperature difference between inside and outside.  This is the essense of design for heat conduction, one of the fundamental processes in the study of Heat Transfer.  In this lesson, we will assume the rate of heat loss is known and try to design a heating system to combat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a few variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_L$ - the low temperature reservoir, in this case the outside temperature\n",
    "$T_H$ - the high temperature reservoir, in this case the inside of the house\n",
    "$\\dot{Q}_{loss}$ - the heat loss rate through the walls of the house\n",
    "\n",
    "By **reservoir** we mean a large body of fluid (usually air or water) at a fixed temperature from which heat can be transferred without changing its temperature.  We assume each of these 3 variables are fixed, known values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/house heating.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the following values: $T_L = 10 ^\\circ C$, $T_H = 25 ^\\circ C$, and $\\dot{Q}_{loss} = 17 kW$.  So, if the house is losing heat at a rate of $17 kW$, how much power is required to keep the inside temperature constant?  It makes sense that it would require $17 kW$ of power to do this, in light of the following diagram:\n",

Thus, both a heat pump and a refrigerator are designed to combat the natural tendency of warm spaces to cool off and cold spaces to warm up, so that everything reaches a thermal equilibrium.  The difference is a refrigerator is designed to maintain the cold space at a specific temperature regardless of the surrounding (wamer) temperature, whereas a heat pump is designed to maintain the warm space at a specific temperature regardless of the surrounding (colder) temperature.\n",

It uses R-134a as its working fluid, the evaporator operates at a pressure of $P_1 = P_4 = 345 kPa$, and the evaporator operates at a pressure of $P_2 = P_3 = 830 kPa$.  The refrigerant leaves the evaporator as a saturated vapor, leaves the condenser as a saturated liquid, and enters the condenser at $T_2 = 40 ^\\circ C$.  Find the power required to run the pump, and the rate of heat transfer from the cold reservoir."

    "These results show that the pump only requires $2.16 kW$ of power to heat the house.  The rest of the power is being pulled from the air outside into the evaporator at a rate of $14.84 kW$.  So, the flow of energy into the house using a heat pump looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/house heating with heat pump.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can see that, indeed, the house must receive heat at a rate of $17 kW$ to balance out the heat loss in order to maintain a constant indoor temperature.  As discussed in the previous lesson, **Conservation of energy** tells us that\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\dot{E}_{in}$ is the rate of energy entering the control volume, $\\dot{E}_{out}$ is the rate of energy leaving the control volume, and $\\dot{E}_{CV}$ is the rate of change of energy in the control volume.\n",

    "If we make the steady-state assumption, we get $\\dot{E}_{CV} = 0$, and so we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{E}_{in} = \\dot{E}_{out}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the **control volume** for the house, this means that $\\dot{E}_{in} = 17 kW$ must equal $\\dot{E}_{out} = 17 kW$.\n",

    "\n",
    "So no where is the principle of conservation of energy being violated.  The advantage of the heat pump is that the majority of the energy needed to heat the house is drawn from the outdoors (which is free energy!) rather than from electricity.\n",

In this example, the evaporator is operating at $P_1 = 345 kPa$ and $T_4 = 4 ^\\circ C$, which is colder than the outside temperature.  Thus, heat flows from the outside into the evaporator, which evaporates the refrigerant from a liquid-vapor mixture to a saturated vapor.  Pumping the refrigerant raises its temperature to $T_2 = 40 ^\\circ C$ without much work (only $2.16 kW$), which is hotter than the desired indoor temperature.  Heat is then lost to the indoors through the condenser.  The expansion valve reduces the refrigerant back to $T_4 = 4 ^\\circ C$ without requiring any work.  Then the cycle repeats."

After all, the pressures and temperatures of the condenser and evaporator were just given; there's no reason why different values couldn't be chosen.  The evaporator temperature must be lower than the outdoor temperature for heat to flow into the evaporator; similarly, the condenser temperature must be hotter than the indoor temperature for heat to flow into the house.  Other than that, we are free to play around with the values.  Even if you keep all of the pressures and temperatures the same, you might wonder if there is a more efficient pump that can pump the refrigerant from $P_1 = 345 kPa$ up to $P_2 = 800 kPa$.  This lesson and the next will give you the analysis tools to answer these questions.\n",

    "\n",

However, we know this situation is impossible, just like a hot cup of coffee does not stay hot forever in a cooler room by exchanging equal amounts of energy with it.  Naturally, energy flows from the hot substance to the colder one, not the other way around.  The cup of coffee will naturally cool until it matches the temperature of the room, heating the room slightly, but it will not spontaneously heat itself while cooling the room slightly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Can we imagine a heat engine that is completely reversible, and hence has the maximum efficiency among all heat engines between two given temperature reservoirs?  As we previously mentioned, friction and heat transfer between hot and cold bodies are irreversible processes, and so if we can minimize these we can (theoretically) approach a reversible process or cycle.  Although this cannot be attained in practice, it provides an upper bound to the expected thermal efficiency of any given heat engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Carnot Cycle** is a 4-step heat engine in which each step is theoretically reversible, and so its thermal efficiency is the maximum possible.  Like other heat engines, it takes in heat energy from a high-temperature reservoir, does some useful work, then rejects heat energy to a low-temperature reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Carnot Cycle for heat engines is composed of the following four processes, each of which is necessarily reversible to make the whole cycle reversible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reversible Isothermal Expansion:** The gas in the cylinder is in thermal equilibrium with the high temperature reservoir at $T_H$; however, the pressure inside the cylinder is greater than the surroundings, and so it expands.  As it expands, the gas cools a small amount, and so, since the reservoir is now warmer than the gas, some heat is transferred into the cylinder.  If the expansion is slow enough, the temperature of the gas remains constant.  This process is theoretically reversible; as the gas is compressed, it heats up a small amount and transfers a small amount of heat to the reservoir, thus maintaining a nearly constant temperature.\n",
    "1. **Reversible Adiabatic Expansion:** During this phase, the cylinder is insulated, so there can be no heat transfer to the surroundings.  The gas continues to expand, doing work on the surroundings, while cooling from $T_H$ to $T_L$.  This process can be reversed: the gas starts at $T_L$ and is compressed in an insulated cylinder until its temperature reaches $T_H$.\n",
    "1. **Reversible Isothermal Compression:** The gas in the cylinder is in thermal equilibrium with the low temperature reservoir at $T_L$; however, the pressure inside the cylinder is less than the surroundings, and so it compresses.  As it compresses, the gas warms a small amount, and so, since the reservoir is now colder than the gas, some heat is transferred out of the cylinder.  If the expansion is slow enough, the temperature of the gas remains constant.  Notice the similarity of this process with the first step.\n",
    "1. **Reversible Adiabatic Compression:** During this phase, the cylinder is insulated, so there can be no heat transfer to the surroundings.  The gas continues to compress, having work done on it by the surroundings, while warming from $T_L$ to $T_H$.  Notice the similarity of this process with the second step.\n",
